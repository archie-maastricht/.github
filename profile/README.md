## Auditory Cognition in Humans and Machines Lab (ARCHIE)

AuditoRy Cognition in Humans and MachInEs (ARCHIE) is a research initiative exploring how humans and machines make sense of sound. Led by Elia Formisano (Maastricht University), ARCHIE  brings together insights from neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence, and information science.

Our mission is to understand how the brain recognizes and interprets everyday sounds—and to develop intelligent systems that can do the same. By combining cutting-edge brain imaging with computational modeling, we aim to unravel the neural mechanisms of sound processing and build neurobiologically-informed AI systems that “hear” the world more like we do.

Whether you’re a student curious about the science of sound, a researcher in cognitive or computer science, or a company interested in auditory AI applications—we invite you to explore our work and get involved.
